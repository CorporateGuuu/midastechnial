# Review and Test Plan for RepairDesk API Client with Supabase Integration

## Steps to Complete:

### 1. Install Dependencies
- [x] Run `composer install` to ensure supabase-php dependency is installed

### 2. Test RepairDesk API Client
- [x] Run `php test.php` to verify API client functionality
- [x] Check output for successful API calls and error handling - Found 404 errors, likely due to incorrect base URL in config.php

### 3. Test Supabase Dummy Data Population
- [x] Run `php populate_supabase.php` to insert dummy parts data
- [x] Verify data insertion in Supabase dashboard or via query - Successfully inserted dummy data

### 4. Test Inventory Sync from RepairDesk to Supabase
- [x] Run `php sync_inventory.php` to sync inventory data
- [x] Check for successful data transfer and error handling - Failed due to invalid RepairDesk API key (404 error)

### 5. Review and Validate Results
- [x] Analyze test outputs for any errors or issues
- [x] Verify data integrity in Supabase - Added Supabase config to config.php, updated scripts to use config, updated README.md with Supabase integration docs
- [ ] Suggest improvements or fixes if needed
